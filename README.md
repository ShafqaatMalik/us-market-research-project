This project uses the **US Census API** (ACS 1-Year Estimates) to identify the **Top 10 US States by Median Household Income**. It demonstrates how to work with APIs, clean and analyze data with **pandas**, and visualize insights with **matplotlib** in Python. This script fetches data from the US Census Bureau API, specifically the median household income by state for the year 2022. It processes the data using pandas and visualizes the top 10 states by median household income using a horizontal bar chart. This small project is useful for market research and product launch strategies.
